# deno-request-logger

An API server built using deno to demonstrate making a record of every incoming request in a local json file. The log data adds 
a bit a the requesting users information and the requested endpoint's information in the log. The purpose is to perform actions 
of our choosing before making a log and also ending up with a log history that is more readibly operable for a pre-defined purpose.
